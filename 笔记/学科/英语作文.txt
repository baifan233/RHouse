Hi,Tom.I m very glad to receive your letter.I heard that you and your family are going to China for the Spring festival.
I m so excited.i m pleasure that you will come here.Welcome!Welcome!
I want to introduce something about Spring festival to you here.In 2020,the Spring festival is during January 23rd to February 2nd.
Spring festival means the family members in each family reunited in a house,
share the delicious food on your table and watch the beatiful fireworks outside the window together during the meal.
That sounds great,right?

Normally,we will set off firecrackers on the first day of Spring festival.And on the second day of 
the Spring festival,we will meet our relatives and friends,visit their homes.After having meals at their houses,
standing near by the window and leaning on it,holding a beer talking about the things about last year or the future...
That's what will we do on Spring festival.But because this fucking 2019-nCoV.We have nothing,nothing.
The meeting between relatives and friends will be canceled.We will stay at home for a whole festival but do nothing.
